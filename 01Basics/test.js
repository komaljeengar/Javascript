const accountID = 1234
let Name = "komal" // characters and strings require double quotes
let email = "k@gmail.com"
let password = "1234"
// let is the same use as var, we just dont use var because of scope issue in javascript
console.table([accountID, Name, email, password]);// this is a way to print things in a table 

//console.log() is another way to print
